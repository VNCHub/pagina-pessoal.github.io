      <h2> Who am I?</h2>
      <p> I am a nerd, a geek. I am probably somewhere on the autism spectrum (as Guido says). 
        I am also a millennial and I venture to say, an eternal student, and why not? If our world is constantly changing. </p>

      <p> See also my resume, my main projects, and my LinkedIn page. </p>
        
      <p> am currently working in the area of cybersecurity, focused on operational efficiency and innovation. 
        And I am studying an interdisciplinary bachelor's degree in science and technology at UNIFESP </p>
